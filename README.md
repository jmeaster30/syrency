# My First Minecraft Mod :)

created with fabric

## Finished

### Breaker
Breaks blocks

### AutoCrafter
Crafts the recipe on redstone signal

### Placer
If block is placeable on the spot then the block/item gets placed otherwise it gets dropped like a dropper

### Fast Hopper
Hopper that pulls 4 blocks per tick instead of just 1

### Growth Detector (WIP)
Observer type block that outputs a redstone signal power equal to how much the plant has grown

## Ideas - 1 (lowest chance) to 5 (highest chance)

### UpsideDown Hopper (2)
Hopper that pulls from the block below

### Splitter (2)
Hopper/block that takes in stuff from top then divides set items out the sides and any other items so out the bottom

### Filter (3)
Hopper that only takes in stuff that matches the filter. can filter up to 5 items at a time if there are no item it doesn't take anything

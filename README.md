# My First Minecraft Mod :)

created with fabric

## Finished

### Breaker
Breaks blocks

### AutoCrafter
Crafts the recipe on redstone signal

### Placer
If block is placeable on the spot then the block/item gets placed otherwise it gets dropped like a dropper

### Fast Hopper
Hopper that pulls 4 blocks per tick instead of just 1

### Growth Detector
Observer type block that outputs a redstone signal power equal to how much the plant has grown. Does not work with vines, kelp, cacti, sugarcane, or bamboo because their age values were not really useful for what I wanted the behavior of this block to be. It works with all other crops though.

## Ideas

### UpsideDown Hopper
Hopper that pulls from the block below

### Splitter
Hopper/block that takes in stuff from top then divides set items out the sides and any other items so out the bottom

### Filter
Hopper that only takes in stuff that matches the filter. can filter up to 5 items at a time if there are no item it doesn't take anything

### Link Chest
A chest but it has an item slot that acts as a key and the contents of a link chest can be accessed from any other link chest with the same link item. It is sort of like the ender chest but with a code and I think there was another chest mod that did something similar but with a color code.

### Miner
Digs a 3x3 tunnel for 128 blocks. Powered like a furnace. I think I want this to work in any direction but I may have it only work downwards

### Mob Grinder
Some kind of block that automatically kills mobs and stores the xp and the items. Then when the player uses the block they get the xp

### Feeder
A block that feeds its contents to any mob that could consume it in a small area in front of the block.
